# frame_conversion
The program converts Pilatus3 images to the Bruker .sfrm format and helps generating proper integration masks for the Bruker integration engine SAINT and (hopefully) offers an easy to use GUI.

It is currently designed to convert data collected at the following facilities/beamlines:
  - Advanced Photon Source / 15ID-D
  - SPring-8 / BL02B1
  - Diamond Light Source / I19-1
